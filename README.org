* Overview

  *Mission*

  The goal of this library is to:

  1. Create useful and efficient methods for JavaScript based on the methodologies that the Python
     language is built on.
  2. Stay true to the native JavaScript concepts and to deviate as little as possible from these
     concepts.
  3. Be light weight and straight forward.  We want as little /magic/ as possible happening in the
     background.

  *Why Python?*

  Python is mostly well known and has a plethora of well thought out implementations and methods.
  The advantages of trying to make things that are the same as in Python is to hopefully avoid
  learning two ways to accomplish the same result.
